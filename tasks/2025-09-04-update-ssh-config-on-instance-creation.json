  "summary": "This task is to implement a feature that updates the user's SSH configuration file (`~/.ssh/config`) when a new VM instance is created or an existing one is started. The feature will prompt the user for an SSH host alias and a private key, and then either update an existing SSH entry or create a new one with the instance's IP address. The CLI will maintain a persistent mapping between the VM instance ID and the SSH hostname, so that once a user makes a selection for an instance, all future updates for that instance will automatically use the same SSH host entry. This needs to work in both interactive and headless modes.",

  "decisions": [
    "A persistent mapping will be stored locally to associate a VM instance ID with a user-chosen SSH hostname. This avoids repeatedly asking the user for the same information. A simple JSON file in a local config directory (e.g., `~/.config/nebula-cli/mappings.json`) will be used for this."
  ],
  "lessons_learned": [
    "The `gcp_vm_manager` tool was missing a `create_instance` function, which has now been implemented.",
    "Unit tests are crucial for ensuring the reliability of SSH config management functionality.",
    "The persistent mapping system works well for avoiding repeated user prompts for the same instance.",
    "Mocking file operations in tests requires careful setup to match the actual file iteration patterns."
  ],
  "issues_risks": [
    "The local mapping file could get out of sync if the user manually edits their `~/.ssh/config` file. The CLI should be resilient to this.",
    "Instance creation requires a zone parameter, which should be validated before attempting creation."
  ],
  "next_steps": [
    "Consider adding validation for SSH key file existence before adding to config.",
    "Add error handling for cases where SSH config file is read-only or inaccessible.",
    "Consider adding a command to list all mapped instances and their SSH hostnames."
